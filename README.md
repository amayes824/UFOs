##  Results:


Using JavaScript and HTML, modifications of the code in the index.html file allowed for the creatation of more table filters. In addition to the date filter, to assist the reader we added filters for the city, state, country, and shape, as shown in the following image:

Using JavaScript, the handleClick() function was replaced in your app.js file with a new function that saves the element, value, and id of the filter that was changed. There are five list elements for filtering in the index.html file. The event listener was modified to detect changes to each filter in the app.js file. The updateFilters() function saves the element, value, and the id of the filter that was changed. The filterTable() function loops through all of the filters and keeps any data that matches the filter values. The webpage filters the table correctly based on user input.

**  one drawback of this webpage is the limited amount of sitting offered.
**  two additional recommendations for further development allow for a more extensive research as well as pictures.
